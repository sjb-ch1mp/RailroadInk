Review Comments:

I review "TilePlacementWellFormed" function in task2 which is developed by Thoraya.
The code is concise and well-documented, the decomposition of this program is developed appropriately. 
And it covers all the situations of the task's instruction. Then,the names of all the variables are quite easy to understand.
The code is run well and passed all tests.  What is more, I appreciate her code so much. 
Because what she thought is like a professional programmer.  Sometimes I think that  "the simplest thinking is the best thinking."
I believe that there are a simpler and better way to write this code with experienced programmers.
But as a beginner like us. Typing code step by step is more suitable for us.
Therefore,the code developed by Thoraya is qualified.
