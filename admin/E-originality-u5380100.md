I declare that the work I have submitted for Stage E of this assignment and all stages before it is entirely my own work, with the
following documented exceptions:

* A field in the class ScoreCalculator is referred to as 'Network Values', which was taken from the Official Rulebook of Railroad Ink Deep Blue Edition (Hjalmar Hach & Lorenzo Silva).
* Assistance with using StackPane in Task 4 taken from a reply to the post ['Insert text at the center of a image']((https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18165662/insert-text-at-the-center-of-a-image)) on StackOverflow by user [Crferreira](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1050679/crferreira).
