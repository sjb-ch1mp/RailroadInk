Review Comments:

In Sam code, there is no specific 20 statements that i can review it, so i review in generally.

* Classification the game classes it was so useful to programming the game, and the methods inside each classes
was clear and easy to understand it.

* Naming the methods and variables is clear, which make it easy to understand it and use it.

* There is some methods and files dons't used, for example:
     -- ComputerOpponent Class --> buildTestDice and buildTestSpecials.
     -- Placement class --> getType, getId, getRow.
     -- ScoreCalculator class --> traversedRoutes file.

   Also he import some  java statements which not use it to any class such as
   "import comp1110.ass2.gui.Viewer" statement  in ImageHandler class and "import javafx.scene.layout.VBox" in class.

* Excellent comments.

* Using the HashMap for the Dices and Tiles it is useful rather than create enum class and defined each one, and write
complex code.
