We declare that the work toward our submission of Stage F was distributed among the group members as follows:

* u5380100 92.5
* u6126217 5.6
* u6136358 1.9

Note: Contribution has been calculated as number of lines of code written by each member out of the total number 
of lines of code (as of 8:15pm 15 May 2019). 

* Breakdown is as follows: 
    * Samuel Brookes: 187 (Dices) + 156 (ImageHandler) + 130 (SpecialTiles) + 1452 (Viewer) + 479 (Board) + 173 (ComputerOpponent) + 100 (Placement) + 31 (PlayerData) + 852 (ScoreCalculator) + 459 (Tile) + 14 (RailroadInk) = 4033
    * Baohong Tan: 242 (RailroadInk)
    * Thoraya Al-Sabti: 83 (RailroadInk)
    * Total number of lines written by team:  4358

* Therefore: 
    * Contribution(Samuel Brookes) = (4033/4358)*100 = 92.5%
    * Contribution(Baohong Tan) = (242/4358)*100 = 5.6%
    * Contribution(Thoraya Al-Sabti) = 100% - (Contribution(Samuel Brookes) + Contribution(Baohong Tan)) = 1.9%
